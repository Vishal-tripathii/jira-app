for settring up backend for angular, 
Create a backend folder
-npm init -y, npm install typescript
-add a new tsconfig.json file and paste the code there
-create a src folder inside backed folder
-create a gitignore file inside backend folder and add node-modules there
-add the data to the backednd inside src -> data.ts and define any at this point necause we need dofferent configs for the data types in backend
-npm install express cors
-creating server.ts file inside src folder -> server.ts
-npm i --save-dev @types/express
-npm i @types/cors
tell cors to accept the request from my localhost 4200
-npm install ts-node --save-dev
--npm install nodemon --save-dev

now in package.json(backend), add start script inside script -> "start": "cd src && nodemon server.ts",

this is basics to start backend

--------------------------------------
the of operator of rxjs makes the vlue as observble
so i'v used it to take values in  home component from taskObservable
----------------------------
added new branch intergating-atabase
-------------------------------------------
-creatd mongodb database, added the getall() call to fetch data from api
-intergated with the frontend as well (for getAll() call only)

-i need to update the database only when there is update, delete, edit on the list
-on every mentioned action, i will update the database, store the updated value in localStorage as well, thats all for thi commit

=-=--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
need to update the header when logged in
need to implement logout
 -for logout, we have to clear the userData
 -user should not able to go back to login after being logged in
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-maintaining a userId of loggedin user which i am also asigning to the newly created task
-now when user fetches the database, he would only retrieve the data which that user have created and not the entire database
